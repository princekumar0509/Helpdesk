# Grading evidence — HelpDesk capstone

> These screenshots and the linked pipeline runs were captured while the project lived in the `session21-python/` folder of [princekumar0509/devops-heros](https://github.com/princekumar0509/devops-heros), before it moved into this repository with its full commit history.

Screenshots were captured on 2026-10-14. `m3-commit-history.png` was re-captured on 2026-10-15 after the history was rewritten, and the `eks-*` files were captured on 2026-10-16 from the live AWS deployment. Terminal images are renderings of the real command output. The exact text of each is in [`raw/`](raw/).

## Live deployment on AWS EKS (2026-10-16)

The same chart now runs on **AWS EKS** in account 284874841362, `ap-south-1`. It was provisioned by `terraform apply` and deployed by the CI pipeline itself through GitHub OIDC. These screenshots were captured from the live pages on 2026-10-16.

The console screenshots were taken through a one-hour, read-only federated sign-in. That is why a few widgets that need extra permissions show "Access denied" or "Data unavailable".

The `m8-*` and `m9-*` files above are the earlier run on a local **kind** cluster, made while the AWS account was waiting for activation. They use the same chart and the same CI-built images.

**Still to do after grading:** `terraform destroy` and its screenshot. See [../README.md](../README.md) §6.
